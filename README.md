This sample project has been created to demonstrate how to

fully functional trial version available from the page below:

After you have installed Debenu Quick PDF Library you will 
need to:

1. Add your trial or commercial key to the source code. Search 
for 'UnlockKey' to see where the license key should be added.

2. You must tell Delphi where to look for the DCU files. Check 
out the Getting Started Guide provided with the DCUs if 
you're not familiar with how to do this.

Debenu Quick PDF Library provides DCUs for all versions of
Delphi from version 4 to version XE5.
